# buckysoap
Buckysoap is a collection of patterns around the Python Data Model and Numpy. I assembled these pattern during my tenure at Acadian Asset Management. At it's core Buckysoap is make of: Atom, Element, Join, Ring, Field, Series
I would like to thank Acadian Asset Management for giving me the freedom to develop these patterns then releasing them to the Open Source.
