Quotes:

"Tomorrow morning," he decided, "I'll begin clearing away the sand of fifty thousand
centuries for my first veetable garden. That's the initial step."
 - Phillip K. Dick, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch

"Out beyond ideas of right and wrong doing there is a field. I'll meet
you there."
 - Rumi

â€œWhatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it."
 - Mahatma Gandhi

Enchantment
"And the fundamental quality of your life... is Enchantment, Attraction to That
Which utterly 'Intoxicates' you... You have nothing to say about That Which is
Attractive except that That Is Bliss, That Is Love, That Is Beauty, That is
Consciousness, That Is Truth."
 - Adi Da Samraj

Love Is Action
"Love is action. It is not action by another or a part of a seperate one. It is
not merely action of body, or feeling, or thought. It is action of the whole
body. It is the disposition of Radiance, prior to self apart and all it's
actions, which are all forms of contraction. It is neither inside nor outside
the individual. It is all all-pervading. It is the prior Condition of the whole
body and all worlds. In love we are each a living Sacrifice, not someone trying
to survive. When Love is altogether true, when Radiance shines so hard it opens
up the hand, then there is only God and God is Love. Love is the Sacrifice of
Man."
 - Adi Da Samraj

Love Is A Freedom
"Love is a freedom for a relationship that is based on self knowledge. And thus
also our relationships are built not on simple love, but on a difficult process
of mutual knowing. And most of love is not deep feeling affection, but a
willingness to work in relationship in order to exceed our limitations and
remain open to others."
 - Adi Da Samraj

"There he goes one of God's Own Prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind
